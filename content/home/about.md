I'm a maths student at the University of Warwick. I'm primarily interested in mathematical modelling and it's applications, especially in biology.

I'm also interested in aerospace and amateur radio. I have a foundation amateur radio license and my callsign is M7GAQ. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in WSPR and APRS for balloon tracking. I'm an active member of [Warwick Aerospace Society](https://warwickaerospace.co.uk/) and have been involved in the drones, satellite and rocketry divisions. I mostly enjoy working on the electronic side of these projects and, while I don't have much theoretical knowledge, I am competent at designing circuits and PCBs that work (most of the time).
