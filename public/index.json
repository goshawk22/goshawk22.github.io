This was likely due to icing. Luckily it started to rise again at 2,500m and didn\u0026rsquo;t reach the ground. It went dark before reaching float but it woke up the following morning at a float altitude of 11.5km based on the pressure. As it was already over Ukraine there was significant GPS spoofing.\nThe balloon was consistently fast due to the jet stream, with a maximum speed of 210km/h (likely faster due to the low precision of the calculation and cap on GPS speed in basic telemetry). Over the course of the whole flight it averaged around 150km/h.\nWhile over the Pacific, just off the coast of Canada, the balloon gained around 500m altitude. This was probably due to stretching. The following morning it didn\u0026rsquo;t wake up.\nThis is somewhat similar to when Pico-5 failed. It seems likely that the stretching causes a leak in the seam which then causes it to go down overnight.\nFuture ideas We will try stretching the balloons before flying to test what pressure the balloon can withstand and ensure that it won\u0026rsquo;t stretch and leak while in the air.\nNew records This balloon is a furthest yet at 16,556km making it the closest yet to achieving circumnavigation.\nThe tracking link for the balloon.\nPictures The tracker before flight\nThe supercapacitor and 100uF capacitors\nThe stone we used to reduce free lift after overfilling the balloon\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pico-7/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePico 7 was the second flight of the new tracker and included many of the improvements mentioned in the last post.

It uses the RT6150A buck boost converter to allow the tracker to be powered from as low as 1.8v. It also features mounting points to allow us to attach 2 panels to either side of the board. It also has a LPS22HB pressure sensor, which we plan to use with extended telemetry.

This worked later that day so we decided to launch the following day.\nWe used a new balloon that should result in a much higher float altitude\nBalloon Specifications:\nModel: Partywoo 50\u0026quot; Volume: ~0.25 m³ Weight: 54.7g Launch day The launch day had significant low cloud, but we decided to launch anyway. It woke up at about 1.5km after clearing the cloud and transmitted consistently until nightfall. It reached a float altitude of 11,500m.\nThe following morning it didn\u0026rsquo;t wake up.\nPost launch testing Testing on the ground revealed that the tracker itself failed to wake up in the morning. The tracker entered a loop where upon turning on, the inrush current from the capacitors etc would cause the solar voltage to break down. This would cause the MCU to reset and the loop would repeat.\nThis was fixed by staggering the startup, adding voltage checks and adding capacitance to both VCC and VIN (solar). When the MCU starts up, it checks VIN to see what the voltage is. It then waits until the voltage is at least 3.3v, which seems to be a safe threshold to assume that there is enough power from the cells, before powering on the GPS and SI5351.\nWe tested this on the ground for two consecutive days.\nFuture design improvements\nLarge ~100uF caps on VCC and VIN.

Initial testing showed that the tracker could complete roughly 1 transmission cycle (10 minutes) when powered by the supercapacitor with the panels in shadow. This should improve the reliability of the power supply to the tracker. We used the same pannel configuration as last time.\nWe decided to use two Qualatex 36\u0026quot; balloons instead of one in an attempt to reduce the pressure in each balloon (the lift for the payload is split between the two balloons). In order to reduce the risk of static buildup we attached the balloons using a length of nylon wire so one floated above the other.\nEach balloon had about 0.85g of free lift and the payload was slightly heavier due to the addition of the supercapacitor and part of a wooden spoon at 19.5g. That made for a total lift of 10.6g per balloon.\nWe added a very small weight to the bottom of the trailing antenna in an attempt to keep it straight.\nWeather on the launch day (11/04/25) was very still with negligable winds and the launch went smoothly. In fact there was so little wind that we could see the balloon for over an hour after launch. Luckily the winds picked up overnight and it covered some distance before morning. Due to launching earlier in the day we were able to confirm the balloon was floating at 8.5km before the sun elevation got too low.\nThe supercapacitor has worked well so far and transmissions have been much more stable, even with low sun elevation. Heavy cloud does seem to still be an issue. The maximum recorded panel voltage is 4.2v, which is cutting it a bit close to the maximum rated charging voltage of 4.2v. Maybe a voltage regulator when we build our own board.\nThe GPS was subject to jamming over Belarus, and briefly over Israel. Luckily they were jamming it with a GPS signal with the correct time, allowing the WSPR transmissions to continue unaffected.\nThe float altitude has risen to approximately 8.8km, likely due to stretching of the balloons.\nThe balloon is still up but we have already set personal records for both time in the air and distance travelled. I\u0026rsquo;ll update the post when it goes down. Tracking link is here\nIsaacs very scientific device for measuring lift. Next Steps We have ordered some PartyWoo 50\u0026quot; (apparently this is half of the circumference?!) round foil balloons that should hold a higher pressure (more free lift and leeway for gas leakage). They should also float at a higher altitude.\nNeed to start developing our own tracker. Definitely some improvements to be made over the current version with regards to weight and sensors. Pressure data would be useful to verify GPS altitude.\nNeed to find a source of hydrogen for slower leakage and higher float.\nPossibly fly an APRS tracker, although coverage seems limited.\nSSTV. Images would be cool.\nTest a cutdown mechanism so we can recover payloads. Would allow us to fly more expensive equipment and get good quality images.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pico-5/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Map\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/pico-5/pico-5-map.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used the same tracker as before but added a lithium supercapacitor in parallel with the solar cells.

We used the helium LoRaWAN network. You can see the code here. DO NOT USE THIS CODE. It has some quite serious problems.\nFirst of all big balloons are expensive and need a lot of helium which is also expensive, so thank you to Haywards Heath College Science Society for funding it.\nLaunch when well but it started to go wrong quite soon after it got off the ground. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a random completely unrelated fun fact now: temperature can be negative (when you measure it in Celsius at least). You can probably guess what went wrong. Something to do with unsigned integers and overflow.\nAt about 18000m altitude, the GPS stopped working. Yes, we forgot to put the GPS into balloon mode. Stupid mistake. Should not have happened, especially since we were already aware of this.\nDid some interesting stuff like trying to estimate location using multilateration. It sort of worked, but also you can just look at the map of hotspots that recieved it and it gives you a rough idea anyway.\nThis balloon actually floated and made it all the way through France to somewhere around the alps, we weren\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly where.\nPicoballoon 1 We made our own tracker, which had problems but also worked. It was based around the RAK3172. STM32WL is pretty cool. It also used the helium LoRaWAN network.\nSome things we learnt: BMP280 does not like being turned on and off and when you use 1M resistors in your voltage divider you also need a capacitor for ADC. Luckily these are all fixable and we were able to modify our PCBs. Surprisingly, the tracker didn\u0026rsquo;t really have any problems after that. We used a 550mAh LiPo battery from a disposable vape we found on the side of the road.\nThe code for this tracker is here\nWe used Datacake for the dashboard. Not perfect but easy to use.\nThe balloon was a 32\u0026quot; Hip Hip Hooray Party balloon from Card Factory. Cost £5 fully inflated. Getting the excess helium out was a pain. Launch was successful from the top of Haywards Heath college. Balloon floated for a bit before popping just off the coast of France.\nAscent rate was probably a bit high which caused the pop. Tracker was also quite heavy (around 30g, don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember exactly).\nIsaac launching balloon The prediction using the picoballoon calculator.\nData can be found here\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s everything I can think of for now, although I\u0026rsquo;ve probably formatted something wrong and will make a few force pushes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/hello/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post will fill in a bit of background when it comes to the balloon projects I have been involved in.
